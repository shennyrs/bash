top command tricks

top -v	->version

array up & down switch through processes 

q will quit top

loadaverage -> 1min, 5min and 15min
	measure of amount of computational work a system performs
	on linux its number of processes in r and s state
	1 cpu, maximum allowed load is 1
	if load is 2.12 the it means that overloaded by 112%

%cpu
	us-user processes
	sy-system processes
	ni-nice value processes
	id-idle cpu
	wa-io wait
	hi-hw interupt sent to cpu
	sw-sw interupt sent to cpu
	st-cpu stealed by the hypervisor
	
tasks
	r-running
	s-sleeping,processes in this state are waiting for an event to complete 
	t-stopped,stopped by a signal
	z-zombiue,doesnt have parent
	
tasks areas
	pid-process id
	user-user who is running the processes
	pr and ni- priority and nice value, less nice value means more priority
	virt-total amount of memory consumed by processes
		-this includes prgrms code,data stoed by process in memory and usage from swap
	res-physical memory used by process which is equal to %mem
	shr-shared memory with other process
	S-states->r,s,t,z
	TIME-total cpu time used by rpocess since it started
	command-name of process
	
USAGE
	k ->kill process and mention SIGTERM/SIGKILL
	
	sorting
		M-by memory
		P-by cpu
		N-by pid
		T-by running time
		can also sort by top -o %CPU
		
	Showing list of threads instead of process
		H or top -H
	Showing full path of commands
		c or top -c
	Tree view
		V or top -V
	listing processes from a user-user
		top -u user
	Filtering out commands from top
		press O
		!COMMAND=sshd - filter our sshd from top
		COMMAND=sshd- shows only commands with sshd
		%CPU>3.0-processes which have cpu utilization more than 3%
		= will clear all applied filters
		
	W will save this settings to .toprc
	
	n will limit the number of process
